Hi!

Thanks for taking a look at my project.  I look forward to your feedback.  To view the project after cloning the repo, run `npm install` in the console to install the required dependencies.  Then enter `npm start` to start the application.  You will have to use Postman or a similiar API client to test the project.  Import the `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file included in the project folder to test using your API client of choice.  Thanks again for your time.

Best,
Brandon
